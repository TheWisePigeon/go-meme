# go-meme
Goofy meme generator built using the goofiest language in the world (Which according to me is Golang) and the imgflip API

This is part of my journey learning Golang. 

## HOW TO USE

You will have to build it from source. Clone the repo, make sure you have golang installed

Run `go build` at the root of the project and you will be given a go-meme binary. Run that binary and enjoy :)

### Features I added/ want to add

- [x] Generate meme and download it
- [ ] Push generated meme into user's clipboard


Feel free to contribute :))
